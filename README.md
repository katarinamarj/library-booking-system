# library-booking-system
This application is built using Express.js for the backend and Vue for the frontend, with Bun used as the runtime environment. The app allows users to browse and reserve books, selecting both the book they want and the library where they will pick it up. All book data is fetched from the Google Books API, ensuring detailed information about available titles.
